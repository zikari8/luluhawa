		"b Huh? You mean that ServantFes thing? Don't care, none of my business.",

		"n How do Servants manifest in the real world every year and recall memories of previous conventions if the Throne of Heroes is atemporal and Servants are merely disposable copies of the real Heroic Spirits? I've long since stopped questioning such matters.",
		"n Anyways, after learning about this event, Alisha suddenly decided with zero authority that all of us Crypters should join with our Servants and see which of us can get the most sales. Really, I think she just wanted to pick a fight and gloat as always.",

		"n Oi. Didn't I just say we weren't attending?",
		"bs Oh, you guys are joining too? Could it be that you're forming your own circle? I'm surprised.",
		"bs Oh, I get it. You're after the prize, aren't you? I should've known. Thanks to that prize, there's been a massive increase in participating circles, this year. Well, that's good news for consumers like me, but it sure makes things hectic.",

		"b Hm, that's true, but drawing manga is a lot of work. Berserker's the only one who's good at drawing so the rest of us would be pretty dead weight.",
		"ds If we're able to sell anything, perhaps some other types of merchandise would work. For example, we could sell t-shirts or trinkets. That way, our lack of artistic experience won't matter.",
		"b That's true, but I don't think those things will sell a lot. Products like that lack exclusivity so they won't have as much draw as convention-only manga.",
		"bs What if we sold used panties!? They're highly coveted items that are easy to produce and are tailored to the core demographic!",
		"b We'll get kicked out of the convention hall if we tried that...",
		"n Ahh, no good. No matter what we think of, there's no good ideas.",
		"n I guess it's only expected since we're literal noobs at this. We don't have any special talents or artistic passions. If we had some sort of artist Servant on our team, we'd be in decent shape, but all of these guys are useless. Like always, Assassin's good for nothing but looking pretty.",
		"n Hold on. Looking pretty...?",
		"b ... Maybe we can publish a photobook.",
		"la Huh? A photobook? You mean like a collection of photos?",
		"ds Would such a thing really sell well? I don't think any of us are particularly skilled photographers, either.",
		"bs Photobook... hm? Could it be, Master?",
		"b Right. It won't just be a photobook of pretty photos. What we'll be publishing at ServaFes is...",
		"b A gravure photobook!",
		"n If we can't draw pretty pictures, all we have to do is take pretty pictures. Lucky for us, we have plenty of eyecandy in our group. As much as I hate to admit it, my Servants are rather attractive. Assassin exudes sexual appeal and Saber is quite the looker too. A photo album full of their pictures would be a certifiable treasure trove for many.",
		"ds I see. Certainly, that is the option that takes the most advantage of our circle's unique talents. It's relatively low-effort and doesn't rely as much on artistic skill and experience.",
		"bs Hm, good photography equipment can be pretty expensive, but it isn't as time intensive as drawing manga. With proper scheduling, you could certainly fill a whole photo album within a week's time.",
		"la Ara~ I'm surprised you came up with such an idea, Master~ I thought you hated lewd things.",
		"b Wh-wha. N-no one said anything about lewd photos. We'll just take some innocent pictures that highlight your beauty, okay? Don't get the wrong idea.",
		"b Anyways, I think that this is our best option overall. I don't know if it's enough to win though...",

		"b ... say, Alisha. If you were in my position, what would you do?",
		"a Hm? Well... hire an actual photographer, I guess. Get someone who actually knows what they're doing and settle for nothing but the best.",
		"a I'll track down the best photographer on the island and make him work for me. If he refuses, I'll just have to beat him up until he complies!",

		"n It was, to be blunt, a very erotic doujinshi. The sexual parts were explicit and graphic, holding nothing back when it came to depravity and degeneracy. It was pure, unadulterated smut suitable for ServantFes.",
		"n The 'story' revolved around two characters: a boy and a girl. The girl was a haughty, rich girl born with a silver spoon in her mouth. No matter what she did, she always suceeded and received praise from everyone.",
		"n The boy was the complete opposite: a poor, lame loser without a single redeeming quality. He was completely unremarkable and nobody cared about him at all. Due to his tragic background, he harbored a bitter hatred towards the wealthy, including the girl.",
		"n At the start of the story, the haughty rich girl bullies the boy to the point of abuse. She uses her high social status to make him her personal servant and treats him horribly. Eventually, the boy gets fed up and snaps. He suddenly forces himself on the girl and gets his revenge by raping her.", 
		"n What follows is a lengthy segment where the boy has his way with the girl's body and then uses it to blackmail her. Over the course of several encounters, he steadily breaks down her pride and dignity with his penis, until she loses all of her bitchiness and is reduced to nothing more than his personal sex pet.",

		"aen 'Squeze out loads of your baby juice into your living onahole! Use me like a cum rag for all of your semen...'",

		"aen What do you think about this story, Archer?",
		"par Hmm, I'm still not sure. What about you, Saber?",
		"aen ... to be honest, I'm not sure I really get it.",
		"aen The first 90% of it makes sense to me. I can understand why the girl's privileged background led to her bad personality and why the boy eventually snaps and gets revenge. Putting aside their intercourse, what confuses me is the ending.",
		"aen From my perspective, nothing but mutual hatred is built between the two through the story, yet it ends with them in love? I don't understand.",
		"aen I suppose I can understand the boy falling in love after she loses the foul temper... but why does the girl fall in love with him after how much he humiliates and degrades her?",
		"par No, no, I think you missed something vital. The girl was already in love with the boy at the start of the story.",
		"aen What? There's no way. How could anyone infer affection from her actions?",
		"aen The girl makes the boy's life a living hell and torments him endlessly. How could she do that if she was in love with him?",
		"par It's because she's in love with him that she bullies him. She doesn't know how to express her affections, so she ends up funneling them in harmful and dangerous manners.",
		"par The girl was someone who received nothing but shallow praise from everyone. Surrounded by compulsory lip service, she was unsure how other people actually felt about her. The boy, however, never hid his true emotions. Because he was so vocal about how much he hated her, he became the only person she actually trusted.",
		"par Over time, that trust became affection. He was the only person she actually felt comfortable around and she began to enjoy his hatred. And in turn, she channeled those strange emotions into bullying him. Because she liked how much he hated her, all she could do was make him hate her more.",
		"par And so, at the end of the story, she's content being his cum dumpster because it's the natural result of his loving hatred.",
		"aen Hmm... I get what you're saying, but I can't say I'm convinced. That interpretation seems a bit too liberal.",
		"aen At the end of the story, where she's lost all sense of self-worth and dignity and merely longs for simple-minded pleasure... can you really call that a show of love?",
		"aen Nothing good comes out of this relationship. Both the characters are still as miserable as they were when the started, if not more so. They never grow as people; they only degrade. Is that meant to signify love?",
		"par ... I believe so. Love takes many forms. It can be strange and weird. It can be twisted and dark.",
		"par It can even... end the world. But even so, it's still love.",
		"aen But it's not True Love. Never harming each other, never rejecting each other, always moving towards a happy future, that's what true love is.",
		"aen People who would betray the person they love are merely scum. Their love isn't real.",
